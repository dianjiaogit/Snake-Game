This time I decide to write a Snake game. It is a very classic video game and it made my childhood. Even today, Snake game is still affecting the game concept of others, it still retains all of its original charm. The most challenging part in this assignment for me is to update the snake body. Therefore, I watched how Daniel Shiffman wrote this game on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM) to get some idea, but I did not fully understand it. So I come out with my own method. I draw a new square after the snake head every time the snake moves, and then delete the last square of the snake. Thus, the source code was fully wroten by myself. To make this game look beautiful, I change the single color snake to a multicolour snake. Moreover, when the snake moves, the colours make the snake look like slithering. The longer the snake, the more colours it has. Other than that, to engage the player, when a new highest score is reached, the words on the score board will turn red to mention the player. Last but not least, the speed of the snake will slowly increase as well to make this game a bit more challenging.
